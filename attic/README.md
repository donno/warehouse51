attic
=====

The place where scripts and programs deemed to incomplete or minor to be
published at the top-level.

For the most part these are as-is at the time they were last worked on. They
might have very minor changes (typo fixes etc), but otherwise.

In some cases these may not be more than a "hello world" stage. For the
Python code it would be Python 2 and if they deal with web services those
services may no longer be around.
