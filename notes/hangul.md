Hangeul (Korean)
================

The language is also commonly referred to as Hangul. Its how it is named on
Wikipedia and in the Unicode standard.

Consonants
----------
There are 14 consonants with 5 tenses (doubles).

The following table gives the Hangul letter and their Romanisation.

|Hangul  | ㄱ | ㄲ | ㄴ | ㄷ | ㄸ | ㄹ | ㅁ | ㅂ | ㅃ | ㅅ | ㅆ | ㅇ | ㅈ | ㅉ | ㅊ | ㅋ |ㅌ | ㅍ | ㅎ |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--|
|Initial | g | kk | n | d | tt | r | m | b | pp | s | ss | - | j | jj | ch | k | t | p | h |
|End     | k ^ | k ^ | n  | t ^ | | l | m | p ^ | | t ^ | t  ^ | ng | t | | t ^ | k | t | p | t ^ |

Ends marked with ^ can also use the  the initial too.

```
TODO: Change the ^ notation to bold the Initial Roman letter instead to mark when it can be used as an End.
```

Vowels
------
There are 8 pure (monophthong) and 13 diphthongs.

* Monophthong - single vowel sound
  An English example is "ah".
* Diphthongs - also known as a gliding vowel. Combination of two vowel sounds within the same syllable.
  An English example is "ow".

### Organised Table

The first row are the 8 pure vowels (monophthongs).
The remaining rows contains the 13 diphthongs.

| ㅏ | ㅓ  | ㅗ | ㅜ | ㅡ  | ㅣ| ㅐ  | ㅔ |
|----|-----|----|----|----|---|-----|----|
| a  | eo  | o  | u  | eu | i | ae  | e  |
| ㅑ | ㅕ  | ㅛ  | ㅠ |   |   | ㅒ  | ㅖ |
|----|-----|----|----|----|---|-----|----|
| ya | yeo | yo | yu |    |   | yae | ye |

|    | ㅚ  | ㅟ | ㅢ |   |   |     |    |

### Basic

There are 10 basic vowels which are ㅏ, ㅓ , ㅗ, ㅜ, ㅡ , ㅣ, ㅑ, ㅕ, ㅛ and ㅠ.
In the table above this is a to i then ya to yu.

Syllables
---------

Start with consonant, middle vowel, optional final consonant.
There may be two final consonants.

There are 5 ways of grouping letters to form a syllable block.
Which one is applicable depends on the vowels.

This grouping is called "assembled writing".

### Syllable blocks/groups

Horizontally
```
C V
```
Vertically
```
C
V
```

With final constant. This is like a 2:1:2 ratio.
```
C

```

First two are side-by-side and final takes up spot underneath.

Romanisation
-----------------

### Names

The following is a collection of what I would call Anglicisation of Korean
names. This is where changes are made to the names after Hangul to Romanisation
described above to make the name seem more British.

As a result, if you transcribing from Romanised version back to Hangul you will
often find yourself needing to use the version on the right.

| Anglicisation | Romanised | Hangul   |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Young         | Yeong     |   영     |
| Park          | Bak       |  	박     |
| Ahn           | An        |   안     |
| Lee           | Yi or Ri  | 이 or 리 |

Disclaimers
-----------
- I haven't learnt the rules about when two final consonants can be used.
- I haven't documented which vowels go vertical or not.
