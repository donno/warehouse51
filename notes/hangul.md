Hangeul
================

The Korean alphabet is also commonly referred to as Hangul. Its how it is name
on Wikipedia and in the Unicode standard.

Consonants
----------
There are 14 consonants with 5 tenses (doubles).

The following table gives the Hangul letter and their Romanisation.

|Hangul  | ㄱ | ㄴ | ㄷ | ㄹ | ㅁ | ㅂ | ㅅ | ㅇ | ㅈ | ㅊ | ㅋ |ㅌ | ㅍ | ㅎ | ㄲ | ㄸ | ㅃ | ㅆ | ㅉ |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--|
|Initial | g | n | d | r | m | b | s | - | j | ch | k | t | p | h | kk | tt | pp | ss | jj |
|End     | k ^ | n  | t ^ | l | m | p ^ | t ^ | ng | t | t ^ | k | t | p | t ^ | k ^ | |t ^ | |

Ends marked with ^ can also use the  the initial too.

```
TODO: Change the ^ notation to bold the Initial Roman letter instead to mark when it can be used as an End.
```

* Each consonant has a name.

### Memorisation
A suggestion for learning add an a (vowel) to the the end then remember them.
So they become:
  * 가 say as kaa
  * 나 say as naa
  * 다 say as taa
  * 라 say as raa/lah
  * 마 say as mah
  * 바 say as baa/paa
  * 사 say as saa
  * 아 say as aa
  * 자 say as jaa
  * 차 say as chaa
  * 카 say as kah
  * 타 say as thaa
  * 파 say as phaa
  * 하 say as haa

Vowels
------
There are 8 pure (monophthong) and 13 diphthongs.

* Monophthong - single vowel sound
  An English example is "ah".
* Diphthongs - also known as a gliding vowel. Combination of two vowel sounds within the same syllable.
  An English example is "ow".

### Single Table
| Hangul | ㅏ | ㅐ | ㅑ | ㅒ | ㅓ | ㅔ | ㅕ | ㅖ | ㅗ | ㅘ | ㅙ | ㅚ | ㅛ | ㅜ | ㅝ | ㅞ | ㅟ | ㅠ | ㅡ | ㅢ | ㅣ |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Roman  | a | ae | ya | yae | eo | e | yeo | ye | o | wa | wae | oe | yo | u | wo | we | wi | yu | eu | ui/yi | i |
| Pronunciation |  ah | ae | yah | yae | uh | eh | yuh | yeh | oh | wah | wae | weh | yoh | oo | wuh | weh | wee | yoo | uh | uey | ee |

Thoughts
* An an alternate for ㅠ / yoo is iew.
* ae and eh sound very similar.
* wuh is like saying W but not as double u.
* uey sounds a bit like it could mean 'hey you' or a sound you make for that
  kind of call or fast 'uh-ee'

### Organised Table

The first row are the 8 pure vowels (monophthongs).
The remaining rows contains the 13 diphthongs.

| ㅏ | ㅓ  | ㅗ | ㅜ | ㅡ  | ㅣ| ㅐ  | ㅔ |
|----|-----|----|----|----|---|-----|----|
| a  | eo  | o  | u  | eu | i | ae  | e  |
| ㅑ | ㅕ  | ㅛ  | ㅠ |   |   | ㅒ  | ㅖ |
|----|-----|----|----|----|---|-----|----|
| ya | yeo | yo | yu |    |   | yae | ye |
| ㅘ | ㅝ  |    |    |   |   |  ㅙ | ㅞ  |
| wa | wo  |    |    |    |   | wae | we |
|    | ㅚ  | ㅟ | ㅢ |   |   |     |    |
|    | oe  | wi | ui/yi |    |   |     |    |

### Pronunciation Practice

This re-arranges the vowels so they somewhat easier to practice the
pronunciation as going a to ya, eo to yeo rather than a to eo, then cycling
back from ya to yeo hopefully works better.

| ㅏ | ㅑ | ㅓ | ㅕ | ㅗ | ㅛ | ㅜ | ㅠ | ㅡ | ㅣ|
|----|----|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|
| ㅐ | ㅒ | ㅔ | ㅖ | ㅘ | ㅙ | ㅚ | ㅞ | ㅟ | ㅢ |

It possible to constructing the Hangul for the second row from the first by
applying the following:
- First four are the first four in the first row with a ㅣ add added to the
  right
- Take the 5th (ㅗ ) make 3 more vowels by joining them with ㅏ, ㅐ and ㅣ
- Take the 6th (ㅜ ) make 3 more vowels by joining them with ㅓ, ㅔ and ㅣ
- Then add the last two together to make euy.

### Basic

There are 10 basic vowels which are ㅏ, ㅓ , ㅗ, ㅜ, ㅡ , ㅣ, ㅑ, ㅕ, ㅛ and ㅠ.
In the table above this is a to i then ya to yu.

Syllables
---------

Start with consonant, middle vowel, optional final consonant.
There may be two final consonants.

There are 5 ways of grouping letters to form a syllable block.
Which one is applicable depends on the vowels.

This grouping is called "assembled writing".

### Syllable blocks/groups

Horizontally
```
C V
```
Vertically
```
C
V
```

With final constant. This is like a 2:1:2 ratio.
```
C
V
C
```

First two are side-by-side and final takes up spot underneath.
```
C V
 C
```

In a 2x2 grid:
```
C V
C C
```

Romanisation
-----------------

### Names

The following is a collection of what I would call Anglicisation of Korean
names. This is where changes are made to the names after Hangul to Romanisation
described above to make the name seem more British.

As a result, if you transcribing from Romanised version back to Hangul you will
often find yourself needing to use the version on the right.

| Anglicisation | Romanised | Hangul   |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| Young         | Yeong     |   영     |
| Park          | Bak       |  	박     |
| Ahn           | An        |   안     |
| Lee           | Yi or Ri  | 이 or 리 |

Disclaimers
-----------
- I haven't learnt the rules about when two final consonants can be used.
- I haven't documented which vowels go vertical or not.
