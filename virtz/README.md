A home for various scripts relating to virtualisation and perhaps
emulation and containerisation.

Tools so far
------------

- vm-dev.py
  This downloads a Fedora CoreOS image for HyperV in VHD format.
  It could however be adapted for other images.
  My evening started with trying to manually download container
  layers before I settled on looking at doing this instead.

Future
------
Provided I continue down this pat the plan is:
- Tool for creating automating the creating and booting of VMs.
