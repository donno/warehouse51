"""Turn a grid of heights into a triangulation.

The common alternative representation which stores the data as triangles instead
of a a grid of heights (i.e dense raster model as common in a digital
elevation model) are a Triangulated Irregular Network or TIN.

In computational geometry they are known as polyhedral terrain.


Approaches:
- Create two triangle for each quad formed by the neighbouring 4 points within
  the grid. This is what the triangles() function does.
- New approach (not implemented).
    1. Selecting Sampling Points - Determine which points to use, the better
      the sampling the better the resulting model, with several researched
      options:
      a. Fowler and Littleâ€™s algorithm (1979)
      b. The Very Important Points algorithm (Chen & Guevara, 1987).
         Chen, Zi-Tan, and J. Armando Guevara. "Systematic selection of very
         important points (VIP) from digital terrain model for constructing
         triangular irregular networks." Auto-Carto. Vol. 8. 1987.
    2. Triangulation
       a. Delaunay triangulation (Delaunay, 1934).
       b. Divide-and-Conquer algorithm (Lewis & Robinson, 1978)
       c. Convex Hull Insertion (Tsai & Vonderohe, 1991).
