breakout
=============
An implementation of the classic Atari game known as Breakout.

The idea behind this implementation is to enable different front ends,
so this comes with a pygame front end.

If I find myself with some more time to work on this I might write a
curses front end.

How to use
---------------------

First, install Python
Secondly, install the pygame package
Finally, run the script.

`$ python pygamebreakout.py`


TODO
---------------------
* Add a way to restart the game
* Show a game over screen
