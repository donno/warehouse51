shenzhenfreecell
================

A very early implementation of Freecell variant called SHENZHEN SOLITAIRE by Zachtronics.

I've called this version freecell because it reminds more of Free Cell instead.

The playable game that this is based on is on [Steam][1]:

I had intended to release a more general playing card engine that was going to
be used to provide a Klondike solitaire game but I lost my work on that due to
a hard drive dying.
