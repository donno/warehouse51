How To Play
---------------------------
  Controls:
    enter - release the block
    r     - restart the game

  The aim is to reach the top by stacking the blocks
  on top of one another if you miss the base you loose
  that block so eventually you will end up with a
  tower of 1 brick in width.

  If the screen goes green it means you have won,
  If the screen goes red it means you have lost the game.

Notes
---------------------------
The game does not have any assets such as font, text or graphics to keep it
lightweight and easy to distribute.

Special thanks to my amazing girlfriend who inspired me to make a game.
