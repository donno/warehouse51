chess-viewer-sdl
================

The goal of this project is to:
1. Render a position using [FEN](FEN) (Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation).
2. Play back a game using [PGN](PGN) (Portable Game Notation).
3. Stretch goal - Watch games from lichess.org

## Implementation

* Uses [Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)](SDL) for interacting with
  graphics hardware.
* Uses [chess-library](2) by [Disservin](3) for parsing PGN (Portable Game
  Notation) parsing and board state.

## Third Party

- The zlib licence applies to [SDL](SDL) itself.
- The Unlicense licence applies to [Chess Merida Unicode TrueType font](0).
  This is chess_merida_unicode.ttf within repository and distribution.
- The SIL Open Font License 1.1 applies to [IBM Plex Sans font](1).
  This is IBMPlexSans-Regular.ttf  within repository and distribution.
- The chess pieces are using the celtic set by [maurimo](4) which is
  licenced under a MIT licence.
